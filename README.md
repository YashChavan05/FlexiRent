FlexiRent – Rental Management System

FlexiRent is a modern, full-featured rental management platform designed to simplify the entire rental lifecycle for customers, shopkeepers, and admins. It offers a seamless digital experience where customers can browse products, check availability, get instant pricing, book rentals, and manage their orders — all from a single platform.

On the other side, shopkeepers (end users) can efficiently manage their inventory, approve booking requests, handle returns, and view real-time insights. To ensure proper business oversight, FlexiRent also includes a dedicated Admin Analytics Mobile App, providing a top-level view of sales, active users, and overall performance.
